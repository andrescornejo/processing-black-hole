# Black Hole Music Visualization Sketch

### Author: Andr√©s Cornejo

This Processing sketch creates a black hole-esque image for visualizing a song.

This project was originally developed for a data visualization course, however I intend to keep this posted for sharing purposes. 

Feel free to fork it.

I have not provided any songs, due to copyright.
You can add your own by placing a song named "song.mp3" in the sketch's data folder.

This sketch was largely inspired by:

Please check them out, as they are really good!

Also, I used [Apple's San Francisco Pro Fonts](https://github.com/sahibjotsaggu/San-Francisco-Pro-Fonts), I do not own them or make them, and all rights regarding the font go to Apple.
